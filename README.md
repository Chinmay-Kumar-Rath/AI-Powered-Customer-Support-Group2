# AI-Powered Customer Support Platform

An AI-powered platform for analyzing and managing customer support tickets.

## Project Structure

- `backend/` — Backend APIs and business logic.
- `ml/` — Machine learning models and classification pipelines.
- `data/` — Project datasets.
- `docs/` — Project documentation.
- `frontend/` — User interface.
- `rag/` — Gemini embeddings, Pinecone indexing, retrieval, and evaluation.

## Knowledge base and retrieval

The starter knowledge base is under `data/kb/`. It contains reviewed Markdown
articles with title, category, keywords, troubleshooting steps, and escalation
guidance. The Pinecone client creates the configured 768-dimensional cosine
index automatically when it is missing.

Set these environment variables locally:

```text
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_API_KEY=...
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=customer-support-kb-rag-vectors
PINECONE_NAMESPACE=customer-support-kb
PINECONE_CLOUD=aws
PINECONE_REGION=us-east-1
```

From the repository root:

```text
python -m rag.index_kb
python -m rag.eval_retrieval
```

For a replacement corpus, regenerate from the PDF and rebuild Pinecone:

```text
python -m rag.import_pdf --replace
python -m rag.index_kb --rebuild
```

The importer preserves existing Markdown by default; `--replace` is required
for an intentional replacement. Failed indexing batches are logged to
`data/index_failures.jsonl` and can be safely retried because vector IDs are
deterministic article slugs.

If Gemini quota interrupts indexing, resume with the last successful article
offset, for example `python -m rag.index_kb --start 248`.

The retrieval evaluation reads `data/kb_test_set.csv` when Person E provides
the shared test set and writes `data/retrieval_metrics.json`.

## Team Workflow

We use GitHub branches and pull requests to collaborate.
